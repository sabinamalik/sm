We are able to utilize the garden from second grade all the way up to middle school. Our second graders visit the garden at least once a quarter. Third to fifth grade students visit the garden at least once a month for a lesson with a farmer from garden farms, where they learn about nutrition, gardening techniques, the life cycle, and more. Sixth graders visit the garden or study plants from the garden when covering life science in class. We have a middle school garden club that is primarily in charge of managing the garden, doing the main harvest and planting. Eventually we plan on bringing the garden to our younger grades as well. Next month our preschoolers will release butterflies in the garden.
